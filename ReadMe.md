LEARNING TOPOLOGIES
===================
####TSV_time.csv
Ignore the weird title. This csv consists of every action commited by a student. We have the student name, timestamp, and action_type.

####activity_sequence_output
This file is the matrix produced by process_file.py. The output file consists of rows that correspond to each person, and each column is a time interval. The ordering of the rows is printed to stdout.

####create_matrix.py
This file is meant to run "fit" the scipy clustering algorithm on our matrix.

####pca01.py
This file is attempt number one at PCA on our matrix.

####process_file.py
See activity_se.... above.

Please add descriptions here for every file you add to the kmeans folder. For direct communication we'll use [Slack](https://learningtopologies.slack.com/messages/general/).
